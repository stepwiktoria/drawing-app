The Drawing app- just like paint:)

Project Description
This project aims to practice basic JavaScript programming skills by creating a simple drawing application reminiscent of the popular Paint program. The application allows users to draw on a canvas, choose tools, change the color and brush thickness, and save and load images.

File Structure
index.html: The HTML file contains the document structure, user interface elements (such as canvas, tool buttons, sliders), and references to CSS and JavaScript files.

style.css: The CSS file defines styles for user interface elements, giving them appearance and layout on the page.

script.js: The JavaScript file contains the logic of the application. It includes variable declarations, drawing functions (e.g., drawRect, drawCircle), event handling (e.g., tool button clicks), and initialization functions.

Techniques Applied
Canvas Drawing: Utilizing the <canvas> element to create a canvas for drawing.

Events: Handling various events, such as mouse clicks, mouse movements, slider value changes, and color changes in the color picker.

Tool Handling: Implementing tools for drawing, such as a brush, eraser, rectangle, circle, and triangle.

Save and Load Images: Functions allowing users to save the current drawing state and load it again.

Dynamic DOM Modifications: Making changes to the structure and styles of the web page dynamically.

This project serves as a hands-on exercise for fundamental JavaScript concepts, including variable creation and method implementation.
